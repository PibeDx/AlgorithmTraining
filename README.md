# Algorithm Training

This repo was created just to manage my personal training in algorithms.

I've divided into 2 folders:

## java 

Right now I'm resolving a lot of algs using java language. Right now there is just a single folder with problems from uva judge to my personal practice.

## cpp

I'm practicing again cpp because I don't remember too many thing from cpp so in the future I'll upload algs resolved in this powerful language.
